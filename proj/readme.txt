CodeBlocks is the main development environment for Flugbuch2. 

MSVC is also maintained, but always leaks behind. 

CMake is mainly for building the debian package.

The others were not maintained, and got removed. If you insist on working in KDevelop or NetBeans, you can grab a project file from an old revision and use it as a starting point.
